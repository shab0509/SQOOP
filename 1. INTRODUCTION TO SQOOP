SQOOP = SQL + OOP

Sqoop is the most prominent Data Ingestion Tool for moving the data from RDBMS to HDFS.

Moreover, to import and export the data, Sqoop uses MapReduce. Also, offers parallel operation as well as fault tolerance.

Basically, Sqoop attains the collection of related tools. We can use Sqoop, by just specifying the tool we want to use but 
with the arguments that control the tool.

--INSTALL : sudo apt-get instal mysql-server mysql-client

Basically sqoop is the component of hadoop built on top of Hadoop HDFS & exclusively  meant for communicating wit RDBMS.
  IMPORT : Move data RDBMS to HDFS
  Export : Move data HDFS to RDBMS

However Sqoop is a data ingestion tool , however it is not meant for processing of the data with some business logic like MR,pig ....

Note: SQOOP is only meant for import of data of RDBMS table but not the logic (triggers, cursor or stored procedure) to be applied 
on table data  

Some key features of hadoop:

* Either sqoop import/export  will happen with respect to hadoop HDFS only.
* Sqoop will communicate with HDFS only.
* if we are communicating with some RDBMS from hadoop using sqoop, 
  the target RDBMS must be a part of compatable RDBMS(will support JDBC/ODBC).
* If we are communicating with RDBMS from hadoop using sqoop ,the RDBMS  specific connector jar shpuld be a part of 
  $SQOOP_HOME/lib
  mysql-connector-java-5.1.38.jar
